# Design

- **Detailed model and description of the systemâ€™s architecture**

- **Detailed specification of at least 5 representative use cases. These should not include Log In, Log Out, and Register**

**Plan to Fulfil Design Criteria for the Portsmouth Recycling App**

**Objective:** To comprehensively address the design criteria for the Portsmouth Recycling App, including use case modelling and architectural design.

**Team:**

- Designer
- Developer
- Subject Matter Expert (SME)

**Tasks:**

1. **Use Case Modelling**

   a. **Designer:** Create a use case diagram that clearly depicts the interactions between the user (actor) and the system's functionalities (use cases).

   b. **Team:** Collaborate to identify and describe at least five representative use cases, excluding basic functionalities like login, logout, and registration. Focus on core features such as bin collection dates, recycling guide, recycling locations, news and tips, and reminders.

   c. **SME:** Provide input on the accuracy and relevance of the use cases, ensuring they align with real-world user needs and recycling practices.

2. **Architectural Design**

   a. **Designer:** Develop an architectural model that illustrates the system's components and their interactions. Use appropriate diagrams or visual representations to convey the architecture effectively.

   b. **Developer:** Provide technical input on the feasibility and practicality of the architectural model, considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

   c. **Team:** Review and refine the architectural model to ensure it aligns with the app's functional requirements and non-functional requirements, such as user interface, accessibility, performance, multilingual support, security, and platform compatibility.

**Deliverables:**

- A detailed use case diagram with clear annotations and descriptions.
- Comprehensive descriptions of at least five representative use cases, including preconditions, steps, and postconditions.
- A well-structured architectural model with clear explanations of the system's components and their interactions.

**Timeline:**

- Allocate approximately one week for use case modelling, including diagram creation and use case descriptions.
- Dedicate approximately two weeks for architectural design, including model development, technical review, and refinement.

**Communication and Collaboration:**

- Utilize project management tools or collaboration platforms to share documents, track progress, and facilitate communication among team members.
- Schedule regular meetings or virtual discussions to review progress, address challenges, and ensure alignment on design decisions.
- Encourage open communication and constructive feedback to refine the design and ensure it meets the specified criteria.
